## Introduction
This repo aims to be a place where all things related to my MSc in AI reseach project will be kept. 

As of today (170922) the exact title of my project is still to be set, but I expect it to be something related to "the edge".     

THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED
Come up, update me!?

## Table of Contents
1. [Notes on Edge Devices and Edge Contents](Notes/edge_notes.md)
2. [Notes for Literature Review](Notes/Research%20Articles/)
3. [Link to any official Documents](Official%20Docs)
