# Problem Statement (100 words)
People with visual impairments are less likely to go into an environment they are not familiar with. This can have negative impacts on their health and wellbeing. 

In a world where AI is being used more and more to solve problems, I propose using deep learning or machine learning methods to develop a system which would be trained to detect objects in the path of a visually impaied user who is navigating a hallway. 

Several tasks will need to be completed to determine the system's feasibility. First, a dataset will need to be gathered using an appropriate type of sensor. That dataset will then be used to train and test a number of DL and ML models to understand which is best at classifying objects. Work will then be done to allow this model to be implemented on a constrained device and the performance of the final model, on the device, will be accessed against key parameters.
