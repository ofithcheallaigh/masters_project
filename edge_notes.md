# Notes on the Topic of "The Edge"

The title kind of says it all. this is where I plan to keep any notes on the (very) general topic of the edge and edge computing.     

More specialised notes on, say, ML or DL at the end will be stored elsewhere.

- The rise of IoT brought an explosion in smart devices connected to the Cloud     
- Cloud networks became conjected and security issues were overlooked (*or at best, not given the attention they needed - SÓF*)     
    - Edge computing is a potential solution      
- Edge ML is a technique which allowssmart devices to process data locally - either using local servers ot at the device level      
- This process is done using machine and deep learning algorithms, reducing relicence on Cloud networks      

The term 'edge' refers to processing that takes place at the device level, or at a very local level. Edge devices, or edge systems can still      
send data to the Cloud, but can do it in a much more efficient manner, and can potentially be more selective about the data which is sent.       

***Edge devices also solve some of the security converns around storing personal information in the Cloud, since data is processed in real-time        
on the device, and as such, personal information is not stored for later analysis.***       

Real time processing is also important when looking at systems in autonomous cars and medical devices.
